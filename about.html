        <p class="biop">Glazed and Glorious opened it's doors in 2017 after one vegan sweet-tooth was tired of the plain ol classic donut. Don't get us wrong, we love a good old classic here at Glazed and Glorious, but our sweet tooths were always craving more. Every since, we are able to keep our buisness up and running thanks to our loyal costumers!</p>

    <p class="gloria">Hi there my name is Gloria Jones and I am the creator of Glazed and Glorious! I am a Plant-Based baker who loves anything sweet! I started baking at the age of 6 but turned vegan at the age of 17. Ever since I felt like my options were low when it came to vegan desrts, especially in Ottawa. Thus came the idea for G+G and the rest is history! </p>
