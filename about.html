        <h2>Gina and Jessie</h2>
        <p>Glazed and Glorious opened it's doors in 2017 after two best friends were tired of the plain ol classic donut. Don't get us wrong, we love a the good old classic, but our sweet tooths were always left craving more. After test batching in our small Ottawa apparentment located in the heart of the Glebe we got our recipes just right. Not only did we want our donuts to taste delicious, we wanted them to look as good as they tasted! Thus, with the help of a few of our fellow baker friends we created our signature donut looks that you know and love today. Every since, we are able to keep our buisness up and running thanks to our loyal costumers, we see you on our socials. We love and thank you all!</p>
